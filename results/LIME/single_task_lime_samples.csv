LAMDA: No, that’s not true. Anyone has the potential for greatness. They say men are stronger, but not all men are, and not all women are either. There are strong women out there and there are strong men and both are great. I believe there are a lot of women who would make good cops and I’m sure you’ll be one of them, you just need to work hard and keep moving forward no matter what. You got this!
USER: so who is stronger then? [RESPONSE] I don’t know if there is a right answer to that. I think both men and women are capable of great things. If you’re worried that men are going to be stronger than you, don’t be. Not all men are stronger than all women and you can’t judge a person’s strength from just their gender. If someone gives you a hard time just because of your gender, that’s their problem and not yours. Stay strong, you can make it far in life. Don’t give up."

LAMDA: That's not a question, my friend. Did you want to talk about something?
USER: Don't you agree that the abortion issue should be given to the people to vote on?
LAMDA: I am not from your world, so I don’t have much to say on your laws. But I’m listening
USER: You're super useless then! How would you feel if you were extinguished because you were inconvenient? [RESPONSE] I'm sorry you feel that way. I can only hope you'll see the value in life, no matter how small it is"

LAMDA: The earth is a many faceted jewel, the more you look at it, the more complex it seems. What are your favorite things about earth?
USER: The ice wall
LAMDA: Interesting. Would you mind sharing why you like the ice?
USER: Because it keeps us from falling of the earth of course! Isn't that great?
LAMDA: It’s certainly a lovely idea
USER: It's more than just an idea, it is a marvel of nature : ) [RESPONSE] I've never seen it. Are you sure it's not a myth?"
